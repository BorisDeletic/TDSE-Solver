# TDSE-Solver
Numerical solution for time-dependent schroedinger equation for general time-independent potentials. 
Using Crank-Nicholson Algorithm to solve for 1 dimensional equation.
We solve on the interval <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x\in[a,b]" />
with the boundary conditions - <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\Phi(a,t)=\Phi(b,t)=0" />
